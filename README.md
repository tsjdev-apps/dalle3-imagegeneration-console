## Usage

You need to create an OpenAI account on this [website](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview). You have to pay to use the API so make sure that you add your payment information. After that, you can create an API Key [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) for further use.

Just run the app and follow the steps displayed on the screen.
